# My Toolbox

A hodgepodge of scripts that you probably won't find useful

#### dl_from_cavatica_list.py
Takes project name and file list and downloads one file at a time

#### vcf_compare.py
Take location of bedtools and vcf list and runs intersect in all possible combos outputting what is not common in that combo.
